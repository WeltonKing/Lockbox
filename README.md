# Lockbox

Authors: Welton King V, David Rademacher

The Pitch: a simple command line application for storing login information which gives the user confidence that their data is completely inaccessible to others

Key Concepts: command line interface, proprietary encryption algorithm, interacting "live" with a database (raw data is never stored), potentially scalable to a server-based model 

Goals and Expectations: ability to save and load login information, implementation of the DES encryption algorithm, intuitive interface, command line based or otherwise
